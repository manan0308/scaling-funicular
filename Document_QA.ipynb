In this section of the settings, you can configure whether XPayroll should file your 24Q returns (for employees), 26Q returns (for contractors), or both. If you\\'re a new customer and want to take care of the current filing yourself, you can also set the FY quarter from which the filing should start.</p> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\"></p> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">TDS returns are filed by the following dates -</p> <div class=\"\"intercom-interblocks-table-container\"\"><table><tbody> <tr> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\"><b>Quarter</b></p> </td> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\"><b>Due date for filing TDS return</b></p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">Q1 (1 April - 30 June)</p> </td> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">31 July</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">Q2 (1 July - 30 September)</p> </td> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">31 October</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">Q3 (1 October - 31 December)</p> </td> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">31 January (of next year)</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">Q4 (1 January - 31 March)</p> </td> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">31 May</p> </td> </tr> </tbody></table></div><p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">XPayroll will typically start the filing process a week before the due date.

Consider an employee with the following custom salary structure - </p> <div class=\"\"intercom-interblocks-table-container\"\"><table><tbody> <tr> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">Basic Salary</p> </td> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">8000</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">HRA</p> </td> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">4000</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">Special Allowance</p> </td> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">4000</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">Employer ESI Contribution</p> </td> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">520</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">Employer PF Contribution</p> </td> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">1440</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\"><b>Gross Monthly Earnings</b></p> </td> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\"><b>17960</b></p> </td> </tr> </tbody></table></div><p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">Now, let\\'s say we need to put a deduction of Rs 5000 to this month\\'s payroll. The gross pay, thus, needs to be 17960-5000 = 12960. </p> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\"></p> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">How do we accomplish this? A simple way to think about it would be to just remove Rs 5000 from the regular components like special allowance, HRA, and basic salary -</p> <div class=\"\"intercom-interblocks-table-container\"\"><table><tbody> <tr> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">Basic Salary</p> </td> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">5500 (8000-2500)</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">HRA</p> </td> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">2750 (4000-1250)</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">Special Allowance</p> </td> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">2750 (4000-1250)</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">Employer ESI Contribution</p> </td> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">520</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">Employer PF Contribution</p> </td> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">1440</p> </td> </tr> <tr> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\"><b>Gross Monthly Earnings</b></p> </td> <td> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\"><b>12960</b></p> </td> </tr> </tbody></table></div><p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">However, if we do this, then our ESI and PF employer contributions will be incorrect, since these are calculated as a percentage of other components (to see how PF and ESI are calculated, please refer to our FAQs <a href=\"\"https://intercom.help/XPayroll/en/articles/5160709-how-are-pf-contributions-calculated\"\" target=\"\"_blank\"\" class=\"\"intercom-content-link\"\">here</a> and <a href=\"\"https://intercom.help/XPayroll/en/articles/5160717-how-is-esi-calculated\"\" target=\"\"_blank\"\" class=\"\"intercom-content-link\"\">here</a>). What needs to be done is that all the components need to be lowered just enough that with the <i>updated</i> PF and ESI values, the gross pay comes out correct. On top of this, there can be added complications of unknown or missing components as well. Overall, this is a problem that cannot be reliably solved using pure math. Hence, in such cases XPayroll removed the custom salary structure, and assigns a new structure which it back-calculates from the required gross pay.</p>\"  https://intercom.help/XPayroll/en/articles/6269959-why-does-putting-in-a-deduction-lead-to-a-custom-salary-structure-being-removed 6167728  Product Update - March 2022    \"<p class=\"\"no-margin\"\"></p> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">Here\\'s how RazorpayX Payroll is better in the month of March 2022. </p> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\"></p> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\"></p> <h1 id=\"\"h_1d0758060d\"\" class=\"\"intercom-align-center\"\"><b>Integrations! 🔗</b></h1> <div class=\"\"intercom-container\"\"><img src=\"\"https://razorpayx-payroll.intercom-attachments-7.com/i/o/502752616/cdfcee0fc2aa2ff3dc953a42/SfCShHnIXAjLDbmEeLVllbVJb2tnh08t0oyAVN-_Wv5jSXerv8Z04OjzjkHmZB_wYl0VpXrMyUhME-irOrPC8yM6PpyMU3r-G3MnAyf-S5TIEKiT4INOBghw4IRlxmFWoDhGpDb_\"\" alt=\"\"image-1-3\"\"></div><p class=\"\"no-margin\"\"></p> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">RazorpayX Payroll has multiple integrations with other software and products and now there is a central location for finding these!</p> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\"></p> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">Click on the <b>Integrations tab</b> on the left navigation bar and view all supported integrations.

The entire additional TDS liability because of that bonus is included in the same month itself, so that the employee received a steady in-hand pay in the months following the bonus.</p> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\"></p> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">For eg, let\\'s say an employee\\'s earnings in a year are expected to be Rs 12,00,000. </p> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\"></p> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">The total TDS for the entire year would be Rs 1,79,400 and it would be distributed in equal amounts, leading to an in-hand pay of Rs 85,050 (and TDS of Rs 14,950) . </p> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\"></p> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">Now let\\'s say a bonus of Rs 1,00,000 is given to the employee. So the total earnings would be Rs 13,00,000, and the total TDS on this would be Rs 2,10,600 (in increase of Rs 31,200). This additional liability of Rs 31,200 would be included in the same month as the bonus, and the employee\\'s in-hand salary would be 2,00,000-(14,950 + 31,200) = Rs 1,53,850. </p> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\"></p> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">The reason for doing this is quite simple. If we do not deduct the entire additional TDS liability, then the employee\\'s in-hand salary for all the remaining months of the year will dip substantially, since they will be paying more TDS every following month even though the bonus was only given for one month.</p> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\"></p> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\"></p>\"  https://intercom.help/XPayroll/en/articles/5759027-how-is-tds-calculated-on-a-bonus-or-any-other-addition 5735901  Connect with a Chartered Accountant Firm  Get help with PT registration, TDS, EPFO registrations and more!  \"<p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">A lot of our customers reach out to us seeking help for registering on the government portals like TDS, PT and more as they are setting up their businesses.

To request an imprest, an employee has to follow the normal flow of requesting a reimbursement, with the condition that the type of reimbursement should be \"\"imprest\"\". The approval flow is also the same as any other reimbursement. If an imprest request is approved, the amount is paid out immediately to the employee, irrespective of your reimbursement settings.</p> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\"></p> <h2 id=\"\"h_4f6f255f6f\"\">Settlement of imprest</h2> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">Imprest is settled automatically by XPayroll. After an employee is paid imprest, the expectation is that they will later file the actual reimbursements for which this imprest was requested. After these reimbursements are approved, XPayroll will settle them against the imprest amount. </p> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\"></p> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">eg. Employee requests Rs 10,000 as imprest, and then files reimbursements for Rs 12,000. </p> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">In this case, XPayroll will first pay Rs 10,000 to the employee (after the imprest is approved), and then Rs 2,000 (after the reimbursements are approved).</p> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\"></p> <p class=\"\"no-margin\"\">eg.
